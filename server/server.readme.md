the command --> nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts tells the ts , to use ts-node engine to run the ts file without compiliing it firrst, since node src/index.ts will cause error 
<!-- 
Let me explain the differences between these TypeScript compilation commands and break down the npm script:

### `npx tsc` vs `npx tsc -w`

1. **`npx tsc`**:
   - Runs the TypeScript compiler once
   - Compiles your TypeScript files into JavaScript according to your tsconfig.json
   - Exits after compilation is complete
   - Useful for one-time builds

2. **`npx tsc -w`**:
   - The `-w` flag stands for "watch"
   - Runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode
   - Continuously monitors your TypeScript files for changes
   - Automatically recompiles whenever a file is modified
   - Stays running until you manually terminate it
   - Useful during development for instant feedback

### Your npm script explained

```json
"dev": "npm run build && concurrently \"npx tsc -w\" \"nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts\"",
"build": "rimraf dist && npx tsc"
```

#### `"build"` script:
- `rimraf dist`: Deletes the "dist" directory (cross-platform equivalent of `rm -rf dist`)
- `npx tsc`: Compiles your TypeScript files to JavaScript

#### `"dev"` script:
- `npm run build`: First runs the build script to ensure a clean compilation
- `concurrently`: A tool that runs multiple commands simultaneously
- `\"npx tsc -w\"`: Watches for changes in TypeScript files and recompiles them
- `\"nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts\"`: Monitors your source files and runs your application with ts-node

This setup gives you a powerful development environment where:
1. Your TypeScript files are continuously compiled to JavaScript (for production use)
2. Your application is simultaneously run directly from TypeScript (for development)
3. Everything restarts automatically when you make changes

It's essentially giving you the best of both worlds - immediate feedback during development via ts-node while still ensuring your project builds properly for production.

Yes, you’ve understood it **almost perfectly**! 🎯 Just a few minor clarifications:

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown of `npm run dev`**
1. **Runs `npm run build` first**  
   - **Deletes** the old `dist/` folder (`rimraf dist`)  
   - **Compiles** all TypeScript files into JavaScript (`npx tsc`) → Creates a **fresh** `dist/` folder with `.js` files.

2. **Runs two processes concurrently (`concurrently`)**:
   - **`npx tsc -w` (TypeScript Compiler in Watch Mode)**
     - **Tracks changes** in `.ts` files.
     - **Recompiles** TypeScript to JavaScript in `dist/` whenever a file changes.

   - **`nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts`**
     - **Runs your app directly using `ts-node`**, so it doesn't need precompiled `.js` files.
     - **Auto-restarts** when any file changes (nodemon watches for changes in `src/`).

---

### **Your Key Takeaways:**
✅ **First, old compiled files are deleted** → New ones are compiled into `dist/` (before `dev` mode starts).  
✅ **`tsc -w` tracks file changes** → Updates the `.js` files inside `dist/` when you modify a `.ts` file.  
✅ **`nodemon` runs your app using `ts-node`** → No need for precompiled `.js` files, it runs `.ts` files directly.  
✅ **Changes in code trigger a reload** → `tsc -w` recompiles files in `dist/`, and `nodemon` restarts the app.

---

### **Minor Fix in Your Understanding**
❌ **`nodemon` does not use `dist/`**  
- `nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts` **bypasses `dist/` entirely**.
- It **directly executes `.ts` files** using `ts-node`, so it doesn’t depend on `tsc -w` or `dist/` at all.

---

### **Bonus Tip: Why Keep `tsc -w` If `ts-node` Is Running?**
- If you **only** use `ts-node`, you don't need `tsc -w` because `ts-node` runs `.ts` files directly.
- But if you **also** want to maintain a compiled `dist/` for debugging or production builds, keeping `tsc -w` ensures that your `.ts` files always have an up-to-date compiled version in `dist/`.
